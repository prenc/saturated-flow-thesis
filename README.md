The repository contains entire code that was written during our experiments on 
diploma thesis - _efficient hydrodynamic model implementations in GPGPU architecture_.

It consists of two parts:
 - _src_ - various variants of _saturated flow model_ implementation parallel and sequential, written in Python, C, CUDA C and OpenCAL framework
 - _tests_ - the script for compiling and testing programs which run on CPU and GPU,
  it can test CUDA C, C and OpenCAL files for more information check __settings.py__ or run script with -h option
